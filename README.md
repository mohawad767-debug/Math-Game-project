🧮 Math Game Project


A simple yet effective C++ console application designed to challenge users with mathematical problems. The game allows players to customize their experience by selecting the number of questions, difficulty levels, and the types of operations they want to practice.

🎯 Project Overview
The Math Game is built to test mental math speed and accuracy. It generates random math problems based on the user's preferences and provides a detailed performance summary at the end of each session.

✨ Key Features
 * 🔢 Adjustable Length: Users can specify exactly how many questions they want to answer per round.
 * 📈 Difficulty Settings: Includes four distinct levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Mix (a random combination of all levels).
 * ➕ Operation Variety: Users can choose to practice Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or a Mix of all four operations.
 * ✅ Real-time Evaluation: The program evaluates each answer immediately and informs the user if they were correct or incorrect.
 * 🏆 Final Performance Report: A comprehensive summary is displayed at the end of the game, including the pass/fail status and a breakdown of correct versus wrong answers.

📊 Final Report Details
At the end of the game, the application displays a summary containing:
 * Total number of questions.
 * Chosen difficulty level.
 * Selected operation type.
 * Number of correct answers.
 * Number of wrong answers.
 * Final Result (Pass or Fail based on the score).

🛠 Technical Implementation
This project was developed using C++ and demonstrates the use of:
 * Structs & Enums for data organization.
 * Randomization Logic for generating dynamic questions.
 * Control Flow (Switch cases, If-Else, Loops) for game management.
 * Input Validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
